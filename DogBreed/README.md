# Dog Breed Project

The motivation of this project was to apply knowledge on two topics that are very related one and other: Convolutional Neural Networks and Transfer Learning. By using Transfer Learning on the most well known architectures such as VGG16 , ResNet50 and InceptionV3, and algorithm was designed to identify the presence of human or dogs in a picture. If the algorithm identified a human, it would try to find the most similar dog breed it looked like. In case it found a dog, it would output the dog breed. The results went quite well, despite the fact a short training was done. The Dog detecting model worked slightly better than the Human Face detector, which confused an 11% of the dog data as humans.

## Files

Inside the Files folder you can find:

1. The Jupyter Notebook
2. Testing Images used to Test the whole algorithm

## Installations

Save the Test Images into an Images/Example folder. Run the jupyter notebook normally. I canÂ´t upload everything such as the dataset or extracted features because of the weight of the files, however, inside the notebook you can find a detailed explanation.
