# Dog Breed Proyect

The motivation of this proyect was to apply knowledge on two topics that are very related one and other: Convolutional Neural Networks and Transfer Learning. By using Transfer Learning on the most well known architectures such as VGG16 , ResNet50 and InceptionV3, and algorithm was designed to identify the presence of human or dogs in a picture. If the algorithm identified a human, it would try to find the most similar dog breed it looked like. In case it found a dog, it would output the dog breed. The results went quite well, despite the fact a short training was done. The Dog detecting model worked slightly better than the Human Face detector, which confused an 11% of the dog data as humans.
