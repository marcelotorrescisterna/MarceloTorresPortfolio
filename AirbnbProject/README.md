# Udacity Nanodegree Project 1: Writing a Data Science Blog

The motivation of the following project was to apply the CRISP-DM methodology to the Airbnb Seattle Dataset. Through different steps, three business questions were answered.  

This questiones where:

1. How was the evolution of the occupation rate along the last 365 days? Useful for understanding if booking has increased, decreased or stayed the same
2. Has there been a significant increase on the price of listings?
3. Which locations have the most amount of listings and how has the occupation rate evolved in them?

## File Description  
Three files were used:

* __Calendars__ : which show if a listing was available or not at a given time. Also the price of the listing.
* __Listings__: different information of each listing
* __Reviews__ : containing opinions of several people about the listings


## Summary of Results

The results show that, regarding Question 1 , there has been a clear decreasing tendency in the Occupation Rate along the last 365 days. Many reasons could be triggering this. By answering Question 2, we find out that prices of the most common listings (apartments, houses and condominiums) have also risen throughout time. Therefore, this could be one of the reasons that the occupation rate has decay. Finally, there are 6 neighborhoods which gather the most of the listings and each of them has suffered a notorious decrease in their occupation rate, some of them even 50%. Capitol Hill, the neighborhood with more listings suffered a 48% decrease.

## Installations

Extract the files into the Dataset Folder, then run the notebook. Everything is specified in the jupyter notebook.
